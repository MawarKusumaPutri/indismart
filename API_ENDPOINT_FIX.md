# API Endpoint Fix - Looker Studio Dashboard

## Problem Identified
The "Analytics Dashboard" page was showing errors when testing API endpoints:
- `/api/looker-studio/dashboard-overview` → 404 Not Found
- `/api/looker-studio/export-complete` → 404 Not Found

Error message: "Unexpected token '<'" indicating HTML response instead of JSON.

## Root Cause
The JavaScript in the Looker Studio dashboard was trying to access endpoints that didn't exist:
- The actual available endpoints were different from what was referenced in the UI
- Endpoint names in the HTML table didn't match the actual route definitions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Identified Available Endpoints
From `php artisan route:list`, the actual available endpoints are:
- ✅ `/api/looker-studio/dashboard-data` - Complete dashboard data
- ✅ `/api/looker-studio/mitra-analytics` - Mitra performance data  
- ✅ `/api/looker-studio/proyek-analytics` - Project analytics data

### 2. Updated HTML Table
Modified `resources/views/looker-studio/index.blade.php`:
- Changed `/api/looker-studio/dashboard-overview` → `/api/looker-studio/dashboard-data`
- Changed `/api/looker-studio/export-complete` → `/api/looker-studio/dashboard-data`

### 3. Verified API Functionality
All endpoints now return valid JSON:
```json
{
  "overview": {
    "total_mitra": 3,
    "total_dokumen": 2,
    "proyek_aktif": 2,
    "completion_rate": 0
  },
  "mitra_analytics": { ... },
  "proyek_analytics": { ... },
  "trends": { ... }
}
```

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED**: All API endpoints now work correctly
✅ **WORKING**: Dashboard loads data without errors
✅ **FUNCTIONAL**: Test buttons in the UI work properly

## Available Endpoints for Looker Studio
1. **Dashboard Data**: `/api/looker-studio/dashboard-data`
   - Complete overview, analytics, trends, and performance data
   - Use this for comprehensive dashboard views

2. **Mitra Analytics**: `/api/looker-studio/mitra-analytics`
   - Top performing mitra, registration trends, status distribution
   - Use this for mitra-specific visualizations

3. **Proyek Analytics**: `/api/looker-studio/proyek-analytics`
   - Project status distribution, timeline, completion metrics
   - Use this for project-specific visualizations

## Test Results
- ✅ `/api/looker-studio/dashboard-data` - Returns valid JSON
- ✅ `/api/looker-studio/mitra-analytics` - Returns valid JSON  
- ✅ `/api/looker-studio/proyek-analytics` - Returns valid JSON
- ✅ No more "Unexpected token '<'" errors
- ✅ Dashboard loads data successfully

## Next Steps
The Looker Studio dashboard should now work properly without any API errors. Users can:
1. Test all endpoints using the "Test" buttons
2. Use the endpoints as data sources in Looker Studio
3. View real-time analytics data
4. Export data for analysis
